## Post Install Instructions
This guide includes optional random setup tweaks that may deliver better experience, know what you are doing, before following.

### Display Size
Recommended display size for better visiblity and usage, use "412".  
Settings -> System -> Developer Options -> Smallest Width  
> Tip: You can disable developer options after setting this as this particular option is persistent.

### Workaround for Source Side issues
- Device Health Services have broken implementation, tries to show battery estimates in QS but doesn't work and leads to qs lags, I disabled that and QS is smooth as well as no funcationality loss noticed by me.
- Prebuilt ASI is pixel8 leading to issues because spoofing is of pixel5, so update ASI, GBoard, Google, and then clear data of all 3 applications.
